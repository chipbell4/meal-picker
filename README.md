# meal-picker
A little tool for figuring out what we're going to eat this week.
Here's a typical usage:
```
$ ./meal-picker -n 3 # give me 3 meals
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tofu Stir Fry
Tofu Curry
Blackened Chicken Salad
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Seed was 1752582683
Dry-run only. Set -r to actually save to Reminders

$ ./meal-picker -n 3 -s 1752582683 -r # I like those choices, add 'em to my Reminders lists
```

Basically, I'll spam `./meal-picker -n 3` a bunch until I get a menu I like,
then I'll "save it" to my Groceries list in the Reminders app by adding the
`-r` flag.

For this to work for you need to
- Be on a Mac
- Have a list in the Reminders app called "Groceries"
- Have a calendar in your Calendar app called "Meals"

The nice part about this is that if you're logged into iCloud, the list will
automatically sync to your phone and voil√° you have a grocery list. The list of
meals/ingredients is in `meals.json`. Feel free to fork and add your own meals.
